16:T5d2,Partial heart transplantation is a novel approach to deliver a growing donor valve in pediatric recipients needing valve replacements. Objective data on the rate of growth of semilunar valves in patients following orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) are necessary to set expectations for partial heart transplant semilunar valve growth. A retrospective cohort study was performed, which included twelve infants who underwent OHT and twelve controls with ventricular septal defects (VSD). Semilunar valve annulus absolute dimension over serial echocardiograms was recorded, Z-scores were calculated, and mixed-effects models were applied to the absolute dimension (mm) and scaled dimension (Boston Z-score). Aortic and pulmonary valve annuli in OHT patients grow. There is a downward trend in aortic valve annulus Z-score over time for OHT patients compared to population norms and controls with VSDs (difference in slopes: − 0.119 Z-score/y, 95% CI: [− 0.209, − 0.029], p = 0.011); there is a non-significant difference for the pulmonary valve annulus (difference in slopes: − 0.067 Z-score/y, 95% CI: [− 0.155 0.022], p = 0.140). Semilunar valves in pediatric OHT patients grow at a slower rate than controls. There was no semilunar valve obstruction in our cohort. While the described difference in valve growth may not be clinically significant for pediatric OHT recipients, these growth rates inform the anticipated growth trajectory for the partial heart transplant graft.17:T7ab,@article{nissen2025semilunar,

}18:T6df,Objective To examine the objective differences and overlap in skin pigment among neonates born to mothers of different racial groups. Study design We conducted a prospective study assessing neonatal skin tone by spectrophotometry using SkinColorCatch (Delfin, Miami, FL) at the pulse oximetry site (dorsum of foot) in neonatal and cardiac intensive care units. Colorimetric indices were compared between non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) neonates using Welch's t test. Distribution overlap was evaluated using the overlap coefficient and the probability of a higher value. Bivariate regression assessed the relationships between colorimetric indices and neonatal characteristics, including gestational age and birth weight. A P value of <.05 was considered significant. Results Among 100 neonates (33 NHB, 57 NHW, 7 Hispanic, 3 other), skin darkness measures (melanin index, perceived lightness, and individual typology angle [ITA°]) were significantly different between NHB and NHW infants. However, substantial overlap was observed: overlap coefficient of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.51-0.83) for the melanin index and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.57-0.90) for the ITA°. The probability of higher value was 0.27 (melanin index) and 0.69 (ITA°), further demonstrating overlap. Lower gestational age and birth weight correlated with darker skin tone characteristics and this association did not differ significantly by race.

A partial waiver of consent offers a potential translational science approach to enhance access to research participation in critically ill neonates. We compared enrollment rates in a study evaluating pulse oximetry accuracy across neonates with varying skin pigmentation before and after implementing a partial waiver of consent. Overall enrollment increased significantly without creating a racial disparity in enrollment, thereby improving generalizability and efficiency in neonatal clinical research.}
}1b:T6dc,OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test the predictive performance of CHIP, an assessment that integrates the Capute Scales, Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE), and Prechtl’s General Movement Assessment (GMA), in relation to future cerebral palsy (CP) outcomes. METHODS: We designed CHIP, an assessment that combines the Capute Scales (Cognitive Adaptive Test [CAT]/Clinical Linguistic and Auditory Milestone Scale [CLAMS]), HINE, and GMA to evaluate cognitive, language, and motor development in high-risk infants aged 3 to 4 months. To test our hypothesis that CHIP predicts later CP outcomes, we conducted a prospective cohort study in infants who were formerly in the neonatal intensive care unit using CP status at ages 2 to 3 years as the primary outcome. We performed univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses with leave-one-out cross-validation to create receiver operator characteristic curves and assess the accuracy, sensitivity, and speci city of CHIP for classifying infants with and without CP. Best subset selection (BSS) was used to assess the performance of reduced models incorporating every subset of CHIP assessments. For 10 children who were lost to follow-up, the prediction equations were used to predict their outcomes. RESULTS: Before the 2-year mark, 10 children were lost to follow-up from our initial cohort of 108 infants. Of the remaining 98 children, 17 had CP, and 81 did not have CP. The CHIP screening model predicted CP well (accuracy, 0.898; sensitivity, 1.000; and speci city, 0.877). BSS identi ed some reduced models that performed similarly well (eg, GMA+CAT+CLAMS).

}1d:Tb99,Background: Mobile health (mHealth) technology has the ability to integrate personalized health management into patients’ daily routines. In prior investigations of mHealth apps for asthma, patient satisfaction and acceptability have been high. However, rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining their effectiveness are sparse; the majority of mHealth asthma apps lack personalization and real-time feedback and fail to include at-risk pediatric populations, and many previous studies are not randomized. Objective: This full-scale RCT will examine the effectiveness of the Pulmonary Education and Asthma Knowledge Mobile Asthma Action Plan (PEAKmAAP), an interactive mHealth asthma action plan (mAAP) smartphone app, among adolescents compared to enhanced usual care (eUC). The study has 3 aims: (1) examine the effectiveness of PEAKmAAP in reducing asthma morbidity, as measured by the Asthma Control Test (ACT) score, health care use, medication use, and lung function; (2) examine the effectiveness of PEAKmAAP in asthma self-efficacy and medication adherence; and (3) examine the impact of sharing PEAKmAAP-generated data with the primary care provider (PCP) for a subset of enrolled subjects. We hypothesize that the PEAKmAAP groups will experience reduced asthma morbidity compared to the eUC group. Furthermore, we hypothesize that PCP data sharing is expected to enhance PCP prescribing patterns and that more adolescents in the Pulmonary Education and Asthma Knowledge Mobile Asthma Action Plan with data sharing (PEAKmAAP-DS) group will have sustained controlled at follow-up visits compared to PEAKmAAP alone or eUC. Methods: Using a 3-arm RCT lasting 12 months, we will assess the effectiveness of PEAKmAAP in reducing morbidity among 432 adolescents (age 12-20 years). The study population includes adolescents with uncontrolled symptoms who receive primary care at the Arkansas Children’s Hospital (ACH) or asthma care at ACH specialty clinics. At baseline, participants are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) PEAKmAAP group, (2) PEAKmAAP-DS group, and (3) eUC group using a smartphone app with daily non–asthma-related notifications. Study procedures will include baseline, 3-month, and 12-month in-person visits and telephone visits at 6 and 9 months.

Participants will complete monthly online surveys to assess health care use and medication use. Results: Recruitment and data collection began in March 2019, and data collection concluded in May 2024. Full data analysis began in December 2024.

}1f:T674,Background The Fontan circulation is the single common pathway for patients with single ventricle defects, but has adverse effects due to passive pulmonary blood flow. Pulsatile pulmonary blood flow may mitigate the adverse effects of Fontan circulation, but a subpulmonary assist device is yet to reach clinical use. We hypothesize that fresh right atrial homograft (cavoatrial partial heart transplant [CAPHT]) may be utilized as a pulsatile Fontan conduit with growth potential. Methods The surgical technique for CAPHT conduit procurement was demonstrated in a live porcine donor. The CAPHT conduit was connected to a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit utilizing different cannulation orientations for inflow and outflow. Electrical activity and transduced pressure were recorded. Results Freshly procured live porcine CAPHT conduits demonstrate pulsatility with extracorporeal perfusion. The conduits have a variable intrinsic rhythm but have the ability to be paced epicardially. With adequate volume loading, the average generated pulse pressure was 9.2 mm Hg. The CAPHT conduit maintains viability and pulsatility for at least 152 minutes while connected to extracorporeal perfusion. Conclusions Our preliminary investigations demonstrate the technique for CAPHT conduit procurement. We show that the right atrium and vena cava can maintain viability pulsatility independent of coronary blood flow in an ex vivo setting. Subsequent in vivo studies will aim to evaluate the viability, function, and feasibility of the CAPHT conduit as an alternative extracardiac Fontan conduit that can be used as a subpulmonary assist device with growth potential.20:T865,@article{TURBENDIAN2025,

  abstract = {Background
The Fontan circulation is the single common pathway for patients with single ventricle defects, but has adverse effects due to passive pulmonary blood flow. Pulsatile pulmonary blood flow may mitigate the adverse effects of Fontan circulation, but a subpulmonary assist device is yet to reach clinical use. We hypothesize that fresh right atrial homograft (cavoatrial partial heart transplant [CAPHT]) may be utilized as a pulsatile Fontan conduit with growth potential.
Methods
The surgical technique for CAPHT conduit procurement was demonstrated in a live porcine donor. The CAPHT conduit was connected to a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit utilizing different cannulation orientations for inflow and outflow. Electrical activity and transduced pressure were recorded.
Results
Freshly procured live porcine CAPHT conduits demonstrate pulsatility with extracorporeal perfusion. The conduits have a variable intrinsic rhythm but have the ability to be paced epicardially. With adequate volume loading, the average generated pulse pressure was 9.2 mm Hg. The CAPHT conduit maintains viability and pulsatility for at least 152 minutes while connected to extracorporeal perfusion.
Conclusions
Our preliminary investigations demonstrate the technique for CAPHT conduit procurement. We show that the right atrium and vena cava can maintain viability pulsatility independent of coronary blood flow in an ex vivo setting. Subsequent in vivo studies will aim to evaluate the viability, function, and feasibility of the CAPHT conduit as an alternative extracardiac Fontan conduit that can be used as a subpulmonary assist device with growth potential.}
}21:T591,Large animal model research is a vital step in the pre-clinical testing of new therapeutic interventions in congenital heart disease to ensure that they are safe and effective before clinical trials are begun. Although swine hearts are an excellent model for the study of cardiovascular disease due to their anatomical and physiological similarities with human hearts, there are differences in body habitus and internal organ positioning that necessitate a deviation from standard human echocardiography protocols. Previously published data on swine echocardiography has focused on mature animals and a standardized protocol for serial valvar assessment is lacking. The aim of this study was to create a protocol for a complete sedated piglet transthoracic echocardiogram. The protocol is designed for the evaluation of ventricular size and function and detailed evaluation of all cardiac valves. Additionally, we demonstrate implementation of this protocol by reporting normative growth trends of semilunar valves and left ventricular dimensions in piglets studied in our research lab. The goal of this standardized protocol is to allow for further cardiovascular research on growing piglets, particularly in the field of partial heart transplantation. Standardized views for valve measurements enable reproducibility across observers and across serial follow-up to reliably assess hemodynamic function and growth over time.22:T7a6,@article{qasim2025transthoracic,
